.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl c
Creates a jail.
See
.Sx CAVEATS
for restrictions on the names of jails.
.It Fl d
Deletes a jail.
.It Fl i
Show information about a jail.
See also
.Xr poudriere-status 8 .
.It Fl l
List all poudriere jails.
.It Fl n
When combined with
.Fl l ,
only display jail name.
.It Fl s
Starts a jail.
.It Fl k
Kills a jail (stops it).
.It Fl r Ar name
Rename a jail to

.El
.Sh OPTIONS
Except for
.Fl l ,
all of the subcommands require the
.Fl j
option (see below).
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl b
Build the source provided with the -m src=PATH option.
.It Fl J Ar number
The
.Ar number
of make jobs will run in parallel for buildworld.
Defaults to the number of CPUs reported by:  sysctl hw.ncpu.
.It Fl q
Remove the header when
.Fl l
is the specified mandatory option.
Otherwise, it has no effect.
.It Fl j Ar name
Specifies the
.Ar name
of the jail.
.It Fl v Ar version
Specifies which
.Ar version
of
.Fx
to use in the jail.
If you are using method ftp then the
.Ar version
should in the form of: 9.0-RELEASE.
If you are using method of svn then the
.Ar version
should be in the form of git or svn branches: stable/9 or head for CURRENT.
Other methods only use the value for display.
.It Fl a Ar architecture
Specifies which
.Ar architecture
of
.Fx
to use in the jail.
(Default: same as host)
.It Fl m Ar method
Specifies which
.Ar method
to use to create the jail.
(default:
.Sy http )
.Pp
Pre-built distribution options:
.Bl -tag -width "ftp-archiveXX"
.It Sy allbsd
Use
.Lk http://www.allbsd.org.
.It Sy ftp Sy http
Fetch from configured
.Sy FREEBSD_HOST
variable from
.Pa poudriere.conf .
.It Sy ftp-archive
Fetch from
.Lk http://ftp-archive.freebsd.org.
.It Sy null
This option can be used to import an existing directory that already contains an installed system.
The path must be specified with
.Fl M Ar path .
It is expected that this directory be installed to with the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/usr/src# make installworld DESTDIR=PATH DB_FROM_SRC=1
/usr/src# make distrib-dirs DESTDIR=PATH DB_FROM_SRC=1
/usr/src# make distribution DESTDIR=PATH DB_FROM_SRC=1
.Ed
.Pp
The path will be null-mounted during builds.
It will not be copied at the time of running
.Nm jail .
Deleting the jail will attempt to revert any files changed by poudriere.
.It Sy src=PATH
Install from the given src directory at
.Sy PATH .
This directory will not be built from.
It is expected that it is already built and maps to a corresponding
.Pa /usr/obj
directory.
.It Sy tar=PATH
Install from the tarball at the given
.Sy PATH .
Note that this method requires the tarball contains the
.Pa /usr/src
files as well if you plan to build any port containing modules.
.It Sy url=PATH
Fetch from given
.Sy PATH .
Any URL supported by
.Xr fetch 1
can be used.
For example:
.Dl "url=file:///mirror/10.0"
.El
.Pp
Build from source options:
.Bl -tag -width "ftp-archiveXX"
.It Sy git Sy git+http Sy git+https Sy git+ssh
Will use git, the -v flag to set the branch name and the
.Sy GIT_BASEURL
variable in
.Pa poudriere.conf .
.It Sy src=PATH
With the
.Fl b
flag, the src tree will be copied into the jail and built.
.It Sy svn Sy svn+file Sy svn+http Sy svn+https
Will use SVN and the
.Sy SVN_HOST
variable in
.Pa poudriere.conf .
.El
.It Fl f Ar filesystem
Specifies the
.Ar filesystem
name (${ZPOOL}/jails/filesystem).
.It Fl K Ar kernelname
Install the jail with a kernel.
If the
.Ar kernelname
is an empty string GENERIC will be used.
If installing from ftp then the default kernel will be installed what ever the
.Ar kernelname
value is.
.It Fl M Ar mountpoint
Gives an alternative
.Ar mountpoint
when creating jail.
.It Fl p Ar name
This specifies which port tree to start/stop the jail with.
.It Fl P Ar patch
Apply the specified
.Ar patch
to the source tree before building the jail.
.It Fl S Ar srcpath
Use the specified
.Ar srcpath
as the
.Fx
source tree mounted inside the jail
or from the host for
.Fl m Ar null .
.It Fl t Ar version
instead of upgrading to the latest security fix of the jail version, you can
jump to the new specified
.Ar version .
.It Fl z Ar set
This specifies which SET to start/stop the jail with.
.It Fl x
Build the native-xtools target using the host's
.Pa /usr/src
tree and copy this
into the jail.
The use of
.Pa /usr/src
is due to a bug in the native-xtools build which does not allow it to be
built from the jail's own source.
Used exclusively
for cross building a ports set, typically via qemu-user tools.
.It Fl C Ar data
Clean poudriere
.Ar data
folders when deleting a jail.
Only used for
.Sy -d
option.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "packagesXX"
.Pa data
